## The Problem
A small startup, who was interested in selling computer hardware, needed the market information of used computer hardware. The subreddit r/hardwareswap is a subreddit that hosts the exchange of unwanted but still useful computer hardware.  They asked me to develop a script to collect all transaction history from the posts of r/hardwareswap.
